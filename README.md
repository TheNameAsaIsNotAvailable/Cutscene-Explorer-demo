# 'Cutscene Explorer demo' (2022)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Run 'Tutorial' to load the mission 13 restaurant scene
- Go into the apartment across the street to configure your setup
- Press the Objectives key (F1 by default) to begin the ambush cutscene
- Use the same key again at any time to exit the cinematic, freeze everything and enable free movement

NOTES:
- You can repeat this process at will, but doing so will always reload the cutscene back at the beginning in its default state
- More cutscenes are hopefully on the way, but it's unlikely I'll be able to get through them all
- When you find bugs (there are things, e.g. flickering scenery and visible buttons during the cutscene), please let me know 
- Thanks for testing and back-up your files, please!
