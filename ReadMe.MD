# 'Cutscene Explorer' demo (2024)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Select **Cutscene Explorer demo** from the Main Menu, and inside the phone booth choose a scene to load.
- Each scene has 7 configuration buttons that can be found nearby (see below).
- Press the Objectives key (F1 by default) to start a cinematic.
- Use the same key again, at any time, to freeze and exit the cinematic.

CONFIG BUTTONS:
1. [Reset Scene] Reloads the level (for cleaning up decals, glitched objects, etc.).
2. [Player Visibility] Toggles your visibility for both gameplay and cinematics. Note that this includes your shadow, but not that of any unholstered weapons. On by default.
3. [Traffic] Toggles any vehicle and pedestrian traffic in the level. Off by default.
4. [Police] Toggles any police presence in the level. Off by default.
5. [Cutscene Car Function] Toggles the functionality of any 'cutscene-only' cars for use afterwards. Note that the toggle setting applies to the *next* time a cinematic is run. Off by default.
6. [Particles] Toggles the continuation of any particle effects (smoke, gunfire, etc.) after a cinematic is exited. Note that while some particles loop indefinitely, others play once and then disappear. Off by default.
7. [The Palermo Clubbing] Clears your inventory and randomly generates one of three possible weapon sets (melee, firearm or explosive).

KNOWN BUGS:
- Game crashes if CS is started with player in a CS car
- (15g) Player anim blending temporarily breaks during first anim transition after load-in
- (15g) Tom's car bounces like a lowrider when CS is started
- (15g) Frequent pop-in
- (15g) Jittery human anim seams in CS

NOTES:
- You can start-stop-start a cinematic at will, but it will always restart from the beginning (no way around this, sorry).
- Sadly, particle effects cannot be frozen in the same way as the rest of the scene. _:(_
- Let me know of any bugs, thanks for testing and back-up your files, please!
