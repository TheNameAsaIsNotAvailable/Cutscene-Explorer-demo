# 'Cutscene Explorer' demo (2024)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Select 'Cutscene Explorer demo' from the Main Menu, and inside the phonebox choose a scene to load
- Each scene has 7 configuration buttons that can be found nearby (see below)
- Press the Objectives key (F1 by default) to begin the cutscene
- Use the same key again at any time to freeze and exit the cinematic

NOTES:
- You can repeat this process at will, but doing so will always reload the cutscene back at the beginning in its default state
- Sadly, particle effects cannot be frozen, so instead you have the option of switching them on/off
- I hope to implement more cutscenes in future, but it's unlikely I'll be able to get through them all
- Let me know or any bugs, thanks for testing and back-up your files, please!

CONFIG BUTTONS:
1. [Reset Scene] Reloads the level (for cleaning up decals, glitched objects, etc.).
2. [Player Visibility] Toggles your visibility for both gameplay and cinematics. Note that this includes your shadow, but not that of any unholstered weapons. On by default.
3. [Traffic] Toggles any vehicle and pedestrian traffic in the level. Off by default.
4. [Police] Toggles any police presence in the level. Off by default.
5. [Cutscene Car Function] Toggles the functionality of any cutscene cars after a cinematic is exited. Note that the toggle applies to the *next* time a cinematic is run. Off by default.
6. [Particles] Toggles the continuation of any particle effects (smoke, gunfire, etc.) after a cinematic is exited. Note that while some particles loop indefinitely, others play once and disappear. Off by default.
7. [The Palermo Clubbing] Clears your inventory and randomly generates one of three possible weapon sets (melee, firearm or explosive).
