# 'Cutscene Explorer' demo (2024)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Select **Scene Selector** from the Main Menu, and inside the phone booth choose a mission to load.
- Each mission has 7 configuration buttons that can be found nearby (see below).
- Use the Objectives key (F1 by default) to start a cutscene.
- Use the same key again to freeze and exit a cutscene.
- Use the wall-mounted phone in each mission to return to the Scene Selector.

CONFIG BUTTONS:
1. [Reset Scene] Reloads the level (for cleaning up decals, glitched objects, etc.).
2. [Player Visibility] Toggles player visibility, for both gameplay and cutscenes. Note that this affects your shadow, but not that of any unholstered weapons. On by default.
3. [Traffic] Toggles any vehicle and pedestrian traffic in the level. On by default.
4. [Police] Toggles any police presence in the level. Off by default (and not currently implemented).
5. [Cutscene Car Function] Toggles the functionality of any 'cutscene-only' cars, for use afterwards. Note that the toggle setting applies to the *next* time a cutscene is run. Off by default.
6. [Particles] Toggles the continuation of any particle effects (smoke, gunfire, etc.) after a cutscene is exited. Note that while some particles loop indefinitely, others play once and then disappear. Off by default.
7. [The Palermo Clubbing] Clears the player's inventory, and randomly generates one of two possible weapon sets (melee & explosive, or firearm).

KNOWN ISSUES:
- (General) 'Switched off' pedestrians are invisible, but retain their collision and interactivity
- (15g) Tom's car bounces when CS is started
- (15g) Distant scenery pop-in - native?
- (15g) Jittery human anim seams in CS - native?

NOTES:
- You can start/stop a cutscene at will, but it will always restart from the beginning (no way around this, sorry).
- Sadly, particle effects cannot be frozen in the same way as the rest of the scene. _:(_
- Let me know of any undocumented bugs, thanks for testing and back-up your files!
